# APA laboratory scripts and notebooks (R and python)

You can clone the repository and run the scripts and notebooks in your computer. 

In order to do that you will need installed:

1. The R language (https://www.r-project.org/) for running the R scripts (optionally you can install RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/)
2. The Python language (at least version 3.6) (https://www.python.org/)
3. The jupyter notebook (http://jupyter.org/install)

If you only want to run the R scripts, you only need the first requirement

If you are using linux, the easy way of installing all the software is using the package manager of your distribution

If you are using windows, for installing python you can use a prepackaged distribution instead of the official distribution like for example Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com). Anaconda also allows to install R using its package manager.

The notebooks are prepared to install the packages you need to run them, but If you want to install them before running the scripts/notebooks, you will have to install:

* for R
    * class, MASS, rgl, scatterplot3d, cclust, ggplot2, RColorBrewer, Rmixmod, car, glmnet, klaR, mlbench,
     e1071, kernlab, nnet, caret, TunePareto, tree, randomForest
* for Python
    * numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, imblearn

For the notebooks, in the doc folder you will find a pdf document for each notebook with the results 

A static version of the notebooks can be obtained in the following links
