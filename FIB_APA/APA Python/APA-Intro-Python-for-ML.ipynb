    "R is ok for most of the tasks for ML, it is older than python and it is very oriented to statistical analysis so it has more specialized libraries for that and if you have to develop a ML proyect in a specialized area more statistics oriented probably you will have R libraries that will solve your problem. Although, once you have your model you will have to resort to other language for deployment.\n",

    "The advantage of this hate/love relationship is that both languages are taking the good things of the other, putting some order in the libraries/tools and allowing to use one language from the other so both communities have access to all tools.
